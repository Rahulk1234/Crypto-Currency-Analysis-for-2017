# Crypto Currency Analysis


*The year 2017 saw a crypto market boom. People who had already made some investments in crypto curriencies were able to bundle up huge profits. Before to that poeple had a very little awareness about the these digital currencies. I gathered around the data for various crypto curriences and to my surprise there are around 1000 such curriencies that existed in 2017*

While not all of them had seen multifold increase in the valuations, some did not see any movement and some had a bad performance. I tried to analyse these curriencies and their valuations and percentage increase/decrease during the 2017 boom.


***We can see the top 10 crypto curriencies that had the highest market capitalization. Bitcoin alone had a market share of more than 50% which indicates that Bitcoin was a major market mover. Etherium acquired the second position with around 12% market share.***

***The plot below shows actual market cap values for the top 10 crypto curriencies***

***The figure plots top 10 winners and losers for percentage change in values in a 24 hour period. Top 10 winners had the highest positive % change in their values which indicates there were highly volatile in nature and had a great bull run while the losers had a negative % change in their values which indicates the currencies with highly volatile and very going down in values quickly. Bitocoin as usual was the top student of the class with 800% increase in 24 hours. This probably should be the highest volatility we have ever seen.***

***Similar to the above here the winners and losers are found out on 7 day period or we can say weekly.***

***We divided the curriencies into three categories:***
1. biggish - market cap  > $300 million
2. micro < $300 million  but > $50 million
3. nano < $50 million

***We can see there are only few biggish crypto curriencies. These few decide the market movement. Most of them are still small ones belonging to the nano category.***
